# OMNI-DRONE-LUA-LIBRARY

Note: 

The `DroneBaseClassKontraption` class was updated to work for VS+Kontraption MC 1.20.1. In recent versions, the 'shipControllerInterface`peripheral from MC 1.18.2 was renamed to 'ShipControllerInterface` with a capital "S". Recently the devs were talking about renaming the peripheral again for thr next update...

If you are trying to use the class in 1.18.2, please edit lib>tilt_ship>DroneBaseClassKontraption.lua and rename the peripheral with a lowercase "s" instead... or you know, you could wait for me to just add a new class specific for 1.18.2 in the next update...
