‚Åπ# OMNI-DRONE-LUA-LIBRARY

rename this folder to "lib" so the classes can find each other

So far Sep 8, 2024: 
the VS+Tournament devs are still working on puting back the API in recent versions for MC 1.20.1. That makes it less convenient to build an omni-drone using Tournament thrusters on 1.20.1 than on 1.18.2. Until then, maybe you can still have fun in 1.18.2 :)

You should still be able to use Kontraption tho on 1.20.1.
